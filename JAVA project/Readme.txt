C0NCEPT OF PROJECT:

1.	To reinforce many of the JAVASCRIPT and programming concepts you may have already met. 
2.	To provide valuable experience of the design and implementation of a large program.
3.	To provide a framework for a more challenging, and thus rewarding, laboratory exercise.
4.	To move the snake, use ‘up arrow' for up, ‘down arrow' for down, ‘left arrow' for left and 
        ‘right arrow' for right as well as ‘w’ for front, ‘s’ for backward, ‘a’ for left, ‘d’ for right.
        Again, there are constants you can change if you want to alter these settings.
5.	Press close the tab to exit the game at any time.
6.	The aim of the game is to collect the dots (food) and avoid the obstacles (crosses, borders, and 
        the snake itself). As you collect food, the snake gets longer, so increasing your likelihood of 
        crashing into yourself. 
7.	When you have collected enough food, you progress onto the next level, where your snake gets longer,
        and the amount of food to collect to progress through the level gets larger.
8.	You get scored according to the length of the snake and the number of 'x' obstacles on the screen.
9.	The speed increases every 5 level. You get a bonus when you complete the level of 1000, increasing by 1000 each level (e.g. complete level 5, you get a 5000 bonus). There is no concept of lives. Once you hit an obstacle, that's it, game over. ? Make sure you do not have the caps lock on, otherwise the keys will fail to respond
