ABSTRACT:
The project aim is to design an android interface, Arduino bot and write program in
to the Arduino microprocessor. Arduino car contains Arduino microcontroller with
basic mobility features. Arduino programs contains instructions mediating between
android controller and Arduino car. Android mobile controller uses different mobile
sensors to supervise motion.
