ABSTRACT:
The project aim is to design an android interface, Arduino bot and write program in
to the Arduino microprocessor. Arduino car contains Arduino microcontroller with
basic mobility features. Arduino programs contains instructions mediating between
android controller and Arduino car. Android mobile controller uses different mobile
sensors to supervise motion.
An appropriate program in the Arduino microprocessor to interact with the android
controller has to be created. The program has been successfully complied through
Arduino IDE to the Arduino microprocessor & loaded in to it after proper checking
of logic to decrease any loss/damage of hardware.
We have to create an android application using MIT app inventor that will provide
user an interface to interact with the Arduino powered car. The interface is easy to
use and provide feedback from the Arduino microprocessor through the Bluetooth
after giving instruction to Arduino for various actions through interface via
Bluetooth module.
The Chassis was designed using Solid Edge and this layout was then laser cut on to
an acrylic sheet
The main objective of this project was to compete in the Technoxian Event and
specifically designed to climb ramps, move in muddy and off-road areas without
any difficulties and to complete the given track efficiently
