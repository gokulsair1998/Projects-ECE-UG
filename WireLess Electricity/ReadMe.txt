Abstract:
The transmission of electrical energy from source to load for a distance without any
conducting wire or cables is called Wireless Power Transmission. The concept of
wireless power transfer was realized by Nikola Tesla.
Wireless power transfer can make a remarkable change in the field of the electrical
engineering which eliminates the use conventional copper cables and current
carrying wires.
Day by day new technologies are making our life simpler. Wireless charging through
resonance could be one of the next technologies that bring the future nearer. In
this project it has been shown that it is possible to charge low power devices
wirelessly via inductive coupling.
It minimizes the complexity that arises for the use of conventional wire system. In
addition, the project also opens up new possibilities of wireless systems in our
other daily life uses

Finding the Length of the Spiral
Before we can find the length of the spiral, we need to know its equation.

An Archimedean Spiral has general equation in polar coordinates:

r = a + b?,

where

r is the distance from the origin,
a is the start point of the spiral and
b affects the distance between each arm.
(2pb is the distance between each arm.)

For both spirals given above, a= 5, since the curve starts at 5.

For the first spiral,

2pb = 0.81, giving us b = 0.12892

So the formula for the first spiral is

r = 5 + 0.12892?

Using the same process,

2pb = 1.4, giving us b = 1.4/(2p) = 0.22282

So the formula for the second spiral is:

r = 5 + 0.22282?

Wireless power transfer (WPT), wireless power transmission, wireless energy transmission (WET),
or electromagnetic power transfer is the transmission of electrical energy without wires as a
physical link. In a wireless power transmission system, a transmitter device, driven by electric power
from a power source, generates a time-varying electromagnetic field, which transmits power across
space to a receiver device, which extracts power from the field and supplies it to an electrical load.
The technology of wireless power transmission can eliminate the use of the wires and batteries, thus
increasing the mobility, convenience, and safety of an electronic device for all users.[2] Wireless
power transfer is useful to power electrical devices where interconnecting wires are inconvenient, 
hazardous, or are not possible.
