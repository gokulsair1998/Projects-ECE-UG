Here in our project we have used relaxation voltage controlled oscillator where the output of this
relaxation VCO which is square wave.
For every change of voltage using the potentiometer gives a corresponding change in the pulse
width of the square wave, this intern changes the time period of the square wave making the
frequency vary accordingly.
The VCO works as an astable multivibrator where the refference voltage is varied but not kept
constant as in case of the astable multivibrator,and so it corresponds to a proportional change in
the time period making the frequency varry
