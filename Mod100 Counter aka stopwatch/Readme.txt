PROCEDURE:
• 1st construct a MOD 100 counter, which is constructed by using two
  mod 10 counter i.e., by cascading the last bit of output of the 1st
  mod 10 counter to the 1st bit input of 2nd mod10 counter.
• The output of this counter is connected to the driver IC or the
  decoder circuit individually as the output of the counter is binary,
  this driver or the decoder circuit converts binary to seven segment
  display inputs which shows number in the form of decimal.
• The outputs of these decoder IC are connected to the respective
  segments of the seven-segment display.
• In order to produce a time delay of 1 sec a function generator
  producing square wave of 1Hz frequency is connected as clock pulse
  to the counter.
